I have parameterised the eyes. Overall I like it but but it is kind of weird when the nose goes in front of the eye. It is also weird that the white of the left eye goes behind the right one yet the pupil goes infront of the right eye which should be changed so the whole eye is behind. I also updated the arrangement page so that 5 faces are drawn on the screen large as I don't think this design works too well when small.  Yes two are half off the page right now but I don't care as my plan is to have it be like someone is driving or walking down a street with the faces as the houses. But I haven't decided which yet.
