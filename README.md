I have added the ear to the face. I don't like the coluor and thing it will look better without a fill. I also think I need to work on reparametersiing it so the ranges of some of the values aren't so extreme and even potentially limit it so that the sideburn can't cover the ear hole and the hole is centred in the space below the side burn. Also the triangle ear just doesn't work atm which needs fixing.
