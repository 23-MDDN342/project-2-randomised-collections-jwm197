I have added the mouth. The mouth can have its y position moved its width and height changed as well as be told whether to have teeth or not and the number of them to have. I think this works really well although there are times now where like the eyes where the inner eye can fill the white of the eyes completely, the mouth can just look black because there are too many teeth in a small mouth
