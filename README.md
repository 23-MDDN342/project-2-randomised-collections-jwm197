For this brief reaction to the brief was I wanted to make a face that was over parametised. I started on off drawing a selection of random faces until I found something I liked. I settled on these asymmetric faces where I can play with ear shape eye size, position and if I draw a eye ball in the socket as well as hair shading direction/if at all, nose size/shape as well as if the mouth is open or not plus its shape. In this left image I just tried experimenting with what versions of the parameters I felt like but for the second I used Bananagrams and threw them down for each feature and used them as a Boolean statement for if I drew features or not depending on if the letters were face up or not, as well as where I the facial features in relation to each other were drawn.
