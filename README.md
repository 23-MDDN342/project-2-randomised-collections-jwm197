I have fixed the last of the issues around the pupil size. I have also made it so if the nose is left facing it doesn't draw the inner ear. I did this because not only do they overlap some of the time but the nose and the ear in this configuation almost contradict the 3dness of the face in that it makes the face feel like the nose makes it feel like the face is side on looking at the left hand side of the face and the ear implies then angle is at 45 degrees from a front on view in the oposte direction. I think that the nose looking left looks good without the inner ear although it still contradicts the 3d effect of the face that the ear really helps sell.
