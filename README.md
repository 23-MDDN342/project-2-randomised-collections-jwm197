I have decided that the nose looks much better with an ear when it is less wide and doesn't overlap onto the ear. As a result I have made it so the nose cannot overlap the ear when the ear is drawn by decreasing the noses width. I have left the nose able to stick off the side of the face to the right. The nose does look good if it sticks off the face to the right so I have left it the same size for that. I also think with this reduced size that the ear looks empty so I have made it so that the nose can still be wide if it isn't drawn. I have also made it so the ear can draw when the nose is facing left again as this doesn't look as bad when the nose is smaller.
